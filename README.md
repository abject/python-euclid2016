*Instructors: Alexandre Boucaud, Mher Kazandjian*

- emails: <aboucaud@ias.u-psud.fr>, <mher@strw.leidenuniv.nl>

This repository contains material associated with the basic and advanced Python tutorial.

## System installation

This tutorial will be using *Python version 3.4-3.5* with the following libraries

- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) (Numerical Python) for efficient manipulation of array-based data
- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) (Scientific Python) for optimization and other routines
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) for scientific visualization
- [AstroPy](http://www.astropy.org) community library gathering astronomical routines

Optionally one might want to install these libraries

- [IPython/Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org) as an interactive computing environment
- [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) a data visualization library

## Downloading the Tutorial Materials

We highly recommend using git, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone https://github.com/aboucaud/python-euclid2016.git

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.  We may make minor changes to
the repository during the tutorial, so cloning the repository is the best option.


## Notebooks

You can access a static view of the notebooks [here](https://github.com/aboucaud/python-euclid2016/blob/master/Index.ipynb).
To modify them, first download the tutorial repository, change to the notebooks directory, and run
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
which will launch a page on web browser with the list of notebooks.
For more information on the IPython/Jupyter notebook,
see http://ipython.org/notebook.html or http://jupyter.org

Note that some of the code in these notebooks may not work outside the
directory structure of this tutorial, so it is important to clone the full
repository if possible.
